Introduction
============

Aegis Validator is a kernel-based integrity protection framework.
Userspace applications, shared libraries, certain data files and kernel
modules are verified during loading. SHA1 hash of the object to be loaded
is calculated in Linux Security Module (LSM) hook function and the result
is compared to a stored reference value. The list of the reference values
is loaded into kernel during boot. Positive verification results are cached
(and indexed by inode number). An object is verified only once after each
boot and an attempt to write to a cached entry removes the entry from the
cache forcing revalidation.

Aegis Platform Security Framework
==================================

Aegis Validator is a part of Aegis Platform Security framework, which
was published in October 2009 Maemo Summit in Amsterdam. Brief description
about concepts is available in:

  http://www.slideshare.net/peterschneider/maemo-6-platform-security

Aegis Validator relies on OMAP Secure Environment services provided
by security driver component (Documentation/arm/OMAP/omap_sec.txt)
and Aegis Runtime Policy Framework access control mechanism. SHA1 hash
calculation is utilizing OMAP SHA1 accelerator. Aegis Validator is a
built-in kernel module and there is a securityfs interface to control
the module and also to update new reference hash values. Securityfs is
a pseudo-filesystem (like sysfs) and is commonly used by security
modules to allow the kernel module to interact with userspace.

Userspace Debian dpkg installer has been modified to update the reference
hash list via securityfs. The initial list is generated and signed by
firmware image generation system. Kernel invokes statically linked userspce
helper application that loads and verifies the reference hashlist file and
translates (pathname,sha1) values into (inode, sha1) values. Bootloader
should pass the SHA1 hash of the userspace helper application to kernel
as command-line parameter. The value is used to authorize userspapce helper
application. When the installer updates the reference hash list it is using
OMAP Secure Environment services to create device specific HMAC signature.

DigSig
======

The original code is based on DigSig open source software (available in
http://disec.sourceforge.net/). DigSig relied solely on signed binaries and
tried to sign all ELF executables by adding special signature section to
executable files. DigSig project added RSA code from gnupg project to Linux
kernel to do the verification. This feature is removed from Aegis Validator.
It is using the stored list of reference hashes for verification.

The original DigSig is meant to be used as Tripwire-like tool for system
administrator to verify integrity of installed binaries. System administrators
can RSA sign ELF applications and libraries and execution of non-signed ELF
code can be prevented. Verification result is cached. Aegis Validator is
using LSM hooks to catch executable code loading. The original DigSig was
implemented as a loadable kernel module and verification public key is
inserted using init script via sysfs kernel interface. Aegis Validator is
mainly used to protect the system against offline tampering attempts and
malware.

Code structure and interfaces
=============================

All code is in its own subtree (security/aegis/validator) except small
LSM hook addon that was added for kernel module verification. Most of the
code is generic. OMAP Security Environment specific code is in separate
module (platsec.c). There are dependencies to kernel-based Aegis Runtime
Policy Framework. Runtime Policy Framework source origin check is
triggered by Aegis Validator. Validator is also using Runtime Policy
Framework services for access checking. This functionality is separated
in sidcheck.c module.

Securityfs configuration interface is in /sys/kernel/security/validator. There
are entries to enable and disable functionality and also to insert new
reference hashes to the kernel. Cache and reference hash list content can
also be dumped for debugging purpose. Validator securityfs entries are:

  hashlist - load new reference hash entries (write), print hashlist (read)
  cache    - print verification cache (read)
  flush    - flush verification cache (write)
  enabled  - enable validator functionality (write), show value (read)
  enforce  - set validator to enforcing mode (write), show value (read)
  modlist  - authorize kernel modules (write), show value (read)

Both enable and enforce allow integrity protection features to be enabled
and enforced separately. The value is treated as a bit mask with fields
(enforce control includes bits 0-3):

  bit 0: enable/enforce SHA1 hash calculation
  bit 1: enable/enforce source origin checking
  bit 2: enable/enforce data file checking
  bit 3: enable/enforce file attribute checking
  bit 4: invoke userspace helper to load more hashes
  bit 5: check only entries that are listed in the reference hash list
  bit 6: if set require the client to own "tcb" Runtime Policy Framework
         credential to allow adding new reference hashes.
  bit 7: if set then only allow loading of new hashes but no mode changes
  bit 8: if set then allow only whitelisted kernel modules

The following LSM hooks are used to interface with the kernel:

  .netlink_send
  .file_mmap
  .file_free_security
  .dentry_open
  .inode_permission
  .inode_unlink
  .inode_create
  .inode_rename
  .bprm_check_security
  .inode_free_security
  .sb_free_security

Reference hashlist values are loaded into kernel by invoking userspace
helper application from kernel. The helper application is reading, verifying
and parsing the reference hashlist file and creates the list of records to
be sent into kernel via securityfs. The list consist of records having SHA1
hash, inode number, mount volume identifier and source origin identifier of
the component. Software installer is also using securityfs interface to add
new reference hashes into kernel.

There is also netlink-based validation error notification mechanism to
userspace. If Validator blocks loading then this error with some context
information is also logged to netlink multicast socket (25).

Features
========

SHA1 integrity check for executables
Enable/Enforce: BIT(0) "HASH_CHECK_BIT"

This is basic functionality of Aegis Validator. Applications and shared
libraries are verified. The check is triggered by LSM hooks .file_mmap
and .bprm_check_security. The object is read, SHA1 hash is calculated and
positive verification result is cached. The object is only verified once
in each boot session and later invocations only lookup verification result
from cache.

Source origin checking
Enable/Enforce: BIT(1) SID_CHECK_BIT

All executable objects are bound to some source origin. The origin is
typically a repository which contains the Debian package having the
executable object. Source origins can have different trust level, which
means that applications from certain repository are allowed to grant more
credentials like POSIX capabilities and resource tokens (concept of Aegis
Runtime Policy Framework). When an object is loaded to execution Aegis
Vaölidator is calling one Aegis Runtime Policy Framework kernel function
to verify that the current process is allowed to load the object.

Data file checking
Enable/Enforce: BIT(2) DATA_CHECK_BIT

There is also limited support to protect data files. Certain directories
can be specified in the reference hash list to be protected directories
and files in those directories should have matching reference hash. The
hash value is checked in file open operation. If the hash does not match
opening of the file is prevented. It is also possible to declare some
files in the protected to be dynamic, which means that those files are
not verified.

Use cases for data file protection are:
  * Protection of upstart configuration files in /etc/init
  * Protection of kernel modules in /lib/modules/*
  * Protection of Perl libraries

File attribute checking
Enable/Enforce: BIT(3) ATTRIB_CHECK_BIT

Aegis Validator also records file attributes (user, group, mode) and can
verify that file attributes are still the same.

Request to load more hashes
Enable: BIT(4) HASH_REQ_BIT

The hash list of the root filesystem is loaded during boot. If other
volumes are mounted and something is executed from the mounted volume
then userspace helper application is invoked to load new reference hashes
to authorize execution of executables.

Checking only listed files
Enable: BIT(5) LISTED_ONLY_BIT

It is also possible to limit reference hash checking to only those files
that are listed in the reference hashlist. If source origin checking is
configured then unlisted executables are treated to come from unknown
source origin.

Use "tcb" resource token to protect hash loading
Enable: BIT(6) SECFS_BIT

Userspace helper can configure Validator to require "tcb" resource
token for clients loading new reference hashes.

Sealing operation mode
Enable: BIT(7) SEAL_BIT

If the seal bit is set during configuration then further configuration
changes (modifications to enable and enforce settings) are not allowed.
It is still possible to load new reference hashes, but loading requires
possession of tcb resource token.

Kernel module whitelist mode
Enable BIT(8) KMOD_BIT

SHA1 hashes of authorized kernel modules can be loaded via modlist
securityfs entry. If this bit is set then all kernel modules are verified
when the module is loaded and only those that are in the whitelist are
accepted.

Hash input message format
=========================

Securityfs entry /sys/kernel/security/validator/hashlist is used to load
reference hashes to Aegis Validator. This is done either during startup
or afterwards if the installer installs new software. There can be four
different messages. The message can be:

1. Old format reference hash message (a)

This message type is still supported because of backwards compatibility.
When all userspace components and other tools have been updated this
message can be deprecated. This message has been replaced by the new
format message, which also includes file metadata fields and source
identifier is numeric instead of string.

2. New format reference hash message (s|t)

This message type adds file metadata fields and source identifier is also
given as numeric identifier instead of textual string value. Exactly same
format is used for executables (s) and static data (t). However those
objects are still separately labeled in the hashlist.

3. Dynamic file entry (x)

Integrity protected directories can also contain configuration files
whose value can change. These files should be declared as dynamic. Those
files are not integrity protected but writing can be controlled and
file attributes can be verified. Note that this message does not include
any hash value, because integrity of dynamic files is not verified.

4. Immutable directory entry (d)

This message type specifies immutable directories. Also this message
does not contain reference hash value. There are two additional fields
that specify resource token and capability mask requirements for writing
to the directory. If those values are zero writing is not controlled.

5. Protected directory entry (p)

This message type specifies directories that should be protected against
unauthorized renaming, removal and the use as a mount poinyt. Also this
message does not contain reference hash value. There are two additional
fields that specify resource token and capability mask requirements for
writing to the directory. If those values are zero writing is not
controlled.

newline   = '\n' character                      (1)

So the minimum length of the message should be at least 14 bytes.
There is odd message termination with "\0\n". The change requires
changes to userspace tools as well.

Potential future work
=====================

Linux kernel version 2.6.30 introduced a new framework called Integrity
Measurement Architecture (IMA). IMA framework partly overlaps with
Aegis Validator as both are measuring loaded executables. However,
IMA is just doing measurements and its purpose is to provide Trusted
Platform Module (TPM) backed measurement agent inside Linux kernel,
which can be used to generate signed replies (signed PCR registers +
measurement log) to remote attestation requests. There is no local
integrity enforcement in IMA, but there are plans to add such module
called EVM.

IMA code could be extended to provide an interface for integrity
enforcement modules. This should be proposed. If succesful then Aegis
Validator measurement code can be dropped in favor of IMA measurement
code. As LSM hooks are not in general stackable it also makes sense
to minimize the use of LSM hooks if there is a need to run another
framework that relies on LSM.
